  "TaskDescription": "The N170 was elicited in a face perception task modified from Rossion & Caharel (2011) using their stimuli. In this task, an image of a face, car, scrambled face, or scrambled car was presented on each trial in the center of the screen, and participants responded whether the stimulus was an object (face or car) or a texture (scrambled face or scrambled car).",
  "Instructions": "In this task, you will be presented with an image of an object (a face or car) or a texture. Your task is to respond whether the image is an object or a texture. If the image is an object, press the [OBJECT_BUTTON] with your dominant hand. If the image is a texture, press the [SCRAMBLED_BUTTON] with your dominant hand. Please respond as quickly and accurately as possible",
