# WP15 - medical imaging

_This contains the draft end-user documentation for the medical imaging use case. Eventually it should move elsewhere and be integrated with the other use cases._

The 2nd use case in the SIESTA project is on medical imaging and restricts its focus to neuroimaging. In SIESTA it is dealt with in work package 15. Hence sometimes we refer to it as "wp15" and at other moments as "usecase-2".

We distinguish between three roles of people interacting with the system.

1. Data rights holder
2. Data user
3. Product owner

Each of these roles has its own section in the documentation.
