The pipeline is expected to be executed on a Linux computer.

## Input data

The input data is a freely available online resource named "OpenNeuro". More specifically, the suject database has [ds003020](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003020/versions/2.2.0) as Openneuro Accession Number. The input data consists of about 992 files with a combined size of 123.01GB. More specifically, the subject database includes 8 subjects. Each patient undergoes 16 sessions, each involving bold fMRI. The data can be downloaded using [datalab](https://www.datalad.org/). In order to be able to use [datalab](https://www.datalad.org/), a recent version of [git]( https://git-scm.com/downloads) is required.
